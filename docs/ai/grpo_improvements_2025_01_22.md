# GRPO Training Improvements - January 22, 2025

## Problem Analysis

The GRPO training was failing to improve beyond the SFT baseline due to several critical issues:

1. **Reward Signal Too Weak**: The LQR reward was scaled by `/100.0`, making the control quality signal extremely weak
2. **Format Rewards Dominating**: Format matching rewards (3.0) were much stronger than control performance rewards
3. **Insufficient Terminal Incentive**: Terminal bonus for reaching origin was too small (max 10.0)
4. **Weak Constraint Penalties**: Only -2.0 per violation didn't discourage boundary violations
5. **No Learning Progress**: Rewards fluctuated between 5-9 without improvement over 500 steps

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Fixed Reward Scaling (CRITICAL FIX)
**File**: `training/grpo_training.py:369`
- **Before**: `lqr_reward = -total_cost / 100.0` 
- **After**: `lqr_reward = -total_cost / 10.0`
- **Impact**: 10x stronger control quality signal

### 2. Amplified Terminal State Incentive
**File**: `training/grpo_training.py:374-382`
- **Before**: 10.0 bonus for < 0.05 error
- **After**: 50.0 bonus for < 0.05 error, 25.0 for < 0.1, etc.
- **Added**: Exponential penalty `-50.0 * (final_error^2)` for poor performance
- **Impact**: Much stronger incentive to reach origin

### 3. Strengthened Constraint Enforcement
**File**: `training/grpo_training.py:384`
- **Before**: `-constraint_violations * 2.0`
- **After**: `-constraint_violations * 10.0`
- **Impact**: 5x stronger penalty for boundary violations

### 4. Rebalanced Reward Components
**Files**: `training/grpo_training.py:252, 267`
- **Format Exact**: 3.0 → 1.0 (reduced dominance)
- **Format Approx**: 1.5 → 0.5 (reduced dominance)  
- **Impact**: Control quality now dominates learning signal

### 5. Added Progressive Reward Shaping
**File**: `training/grpo_training.py:278-300`
- **Terminal bonuses** scale 1x to 3x stronger as training progresses
- **Constraint penalties** become stricter over time
- **Smoothness rewards** added for control sequence quality
- **Impact**: Better learning dynamics throughout training

### 6. Enhanced Monitoring & Logging
**File**: `scripts/train_grpo_params.py:389-410`
- **Added**: Per-component reward tracking
- **Added**: Training progress monitoring
- **Added**: Better debugging information
- **Impact**: Easier to diagnose training issues

### 7. Optimized Training Configuration
**File**: `scripts/train_grpo_params.py:245`
- **Minimum steps**: Ensure at least 500 training steps
- **Save frequency**: Every 50 steps instead of 500
- **Kept**: `num_generations=16` as requested by user
- **Kept**: `temperature=1.0` as requested by user

## Expected Results

With these improvements, the model should now:

1. **Learn to reach origin**: Strong terminal bonuses (50.0 vs 10.0) provide clear objective
2. **Avoid boundaries**: 5x stronger constraint penalties prevent divergent trajectories  
3. **Improve over time**: Progressive shaping increases precision requirements
4. **Show clear progress**: Better logging reveals which reward components are working

## Key Insight

The core issue was **reward imbalance**: the model received stronger rewards for formatting (3.0) than for actually controlling the system to the origin. By rebalancing these rewards and amplifying the control objective, GRPO should now learn effective control policies.

## Next Steps

1. Run training with improved reward function
2. Monitor per-component rewards during training
3. Verify trajectories converge to origin rather than diverging to boundaries
4. Compare final error rates with optimal LQR solutions

The improvements maintain all user preferences (high num_generations, temperature ≥ 1.0) while fixing the fundamental reward signal issues that prevented learning.
