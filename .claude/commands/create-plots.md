# Results Visualizer

You are tasked with creating publication-ready plots, visualizations, and figures from experimental results for the Universal Control LLM Framework.

## Instructions

1. **Use the results-visualizer agent** for professional scientific visualization
2. **Publication-Quality Plots**:
   - Create professional figures with proper formatting
   - Generate trajectory plots with optimal comparison
   - Produce phase portraits and vector field visualizations
   - Design statistical comparison plots with significance testing

3. **Comprehensive Visualization Suites**:
   - Performance comparison dashboards
   - Training dynamics and convergence analysis
   - Multi-system comparative analysis
   - Statistical significance testing with error bars

4. **Scientific Standards**:
   - Follow publication guidelines and formatting standards
   - Ensure high-resolution output in multiple formats (PDF, PNG, SVG)
   - Generate LaTeX-ready figures with proper captions
   - Maintain visual consistency across all plots

5. **Interactive and Animated Visualizations**:
   - Interactive trajectory explorers and dashboards
   - Animated trajectory evolution for presentations
   - Real-time performance monitoring plots
   - Web-based visualization dashboards

## Usage Examples

- `/create-plots` - Generate publication-ready visualizations
- Can create specific plot types or comprehensive figure sets
- Provides statistical analysis integration and significance testing
- Generates professional figures suitable for papers and presentations

## Agent Integration

This command automatically invokes the `results-visualizer` agent with specialized knowledge of:
- Scientific visualization standards and best practices
- Control systems specific plotting and phase space analysis
- Statistical visualization and significance testing
- Publication-quality figure generation and formatting
- Interactive and animated visualization techniques

The agent creates clear, informative, and publication-ready visualizations that effectively communicate experimental results and scientific insights.
