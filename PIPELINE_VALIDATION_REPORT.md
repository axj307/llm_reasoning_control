## 6. Van der Pol System Analysis

### Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (Performance Issues)

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Solver Interface Mismatch:**
```python
# PROBLEM: VDP solver expected separate parameters
def solve_van_der_pol_optimal(x0: float, v0: float, ...)  # ‚ùå

# SOLUTION: Added wrapper function to match interface
def solve_van_der_pol_optimal(initial_state, dt: float, steps: int, ...)  # ‚úÖ
```

2. **Performance Issues:**
   - Van der Pol data generation times out (>60 seconds for 20 samples)
   - Numerical optimization is computationally expensive
   - scipy.optimize.minimize with SLSQP method is slow for this problem

**Fix Applied:**
- Created wrapper function to match data pipeline interface
- Solver interface now consistent with double_integrator approach

**Remaining Issues:**
- Performance optimization needed for practical use
- Consider alternative optimization methods (e.g., direct shooting, MPC)
- May need simpler cost function or initialization

### Status: ‚úÖ AVAILABLE (Not Fully Tested)

**Script Analysis:**
- Universal training script is present and functional
- Supports both SFT and GRPO training types

    --systems double_integrator,van_der_pol \
    --training-type sft \
    --samples-per-system 500 \
    --lora-rank 8
```

**Not Tested Due to:**
- Van der Pol dataset generation performance issues
